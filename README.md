# 🏥 ClaimCure

**Heal with care, pay what's fair.**

ClaimCure is an AI-powered medical bill negotiator designed to ensure you never overpay for healthcare. With our application, you can upload an image of your medical bill—ideally itemized—and let our app work its magic. ClaimCure parses the document for procedure descriptions, codes, and costs, comparing them against nationally gathered data to determine if the price you received is fair.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Parsing:** Automatically extracts procedure details, codes, and costs from uploaded medical bills.
- **Cost Comparison:** Compares billed amounts with trusted national databases to identify overcharges.
- **Email Template Generation:** Provides a pre-written, customizable email template breaking down unfair or inflated charges to send to the hospital.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive design for seamless user experience.

## 📸 How It Works
